# MediGuide_Prolog

The General Healthcare Chatbot, or MediGuide, aims to develop a simple healthcare
chatbot. MediGuide will be developed entirely in Prolog. The chatbot will serve as a guide for
healthcare-related inquiries and assistance. The features offered by the chatbot will enhance the
healthcare experience by including the following features:
1. FAQ Response System - The chatbot will answer frequently asked questions about
healthcare, providing patients with instant and accurate information related to the
patient’s symptoms, medical conditions, possible diagnoses (common illnesses relative to
symptoms), and recommended treatments. The logic-based approach would ensure that
users have access to reliable healthcare information empowering them to make informed
decisions about their well-being.
2. Mental Health Support - The chatbot will offer a compassionate and empathetic
approach to discussing patients’ mental health. This feature is meant to be a preliminary
step to addressing mental health concerns before seeking professional health. Patients
will also be provided with resources to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health
challenges.
3. Hospitals Locator - In response to user queries, the chatbot will provide a list of hospitals
by district/city/province by leveraging. (The chatbot will be localized to Thailand.) The
logic-based approach will allow the chatbot to provide localized lists, and allow users to
identify healthcare providers.
4. Emergency Assistance - The chatbot will provide emergency contact numbers for local
medical services, ambulance services, and other crucial support.
